4166 Milestone 4 (Unfinished)
This is unfinished code that I late turned in using a teachers solution with changes. 
Due to Covid and classes changing and being allowed to use her code. I decided to go with hers and make 
the changes needed for the code.
It is in Node.js and CSS. The CSS will look funky as I did code for a specific aspect ratio and a specific pixel density
which was not a great idea to do as anything other than the specific pixel density and aspect ratio looked weird.
